mVi Academy simplifies machine vision and virtual instrument solution by using LabVIEW.
Our mission is to accelerate engineering productivity, reduce development complexity, and enable scalable, high‑performance system design through:
- **End‑to‑end engineering workflows** covering system architecture, algorithm design, hardware integration, real‑time deployment, and lifecycle support.
- **Open‑source mVi Academy frameworks and templates** engineered for scalable, modular, and maintainable LabVIEW applications.
- **Expert‑led training and consulting** built on our own published technical books and industry‑proven methodologies.
- **Curated technical resources** including recommended books, reusable source code modules, and structured video courses for accelerated learning.
- **A comprehensive engineering library** featuring hardware datasheets, eBooks, manuals, and development tools to support rapid prototyping and system optimization.
mVi Academy is built for LabVIEW developers, machine vision engineers, automation teams, and educators who need reliable, scalable tools for vision and test‑system development. They choose mVi Academy to reduce development time, lower engineering effort, and leverage proven frameworks backed by expert guidance and practical resources.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
